		   <p class="mt-5">Beard oil acts as a moisturizer that goes straight to the hair follicle and restricts hair from growing brittle, especially in cold, windy environments[2] as these weather conditions cause the natural moisture of the beard area to wick. Hydration around this area helps prevent flaking, dandruff and skin dryness. Some brands of beard oil may contain added vitamins or nutrients such as vitamin E. This moisturization prevents general itchiness and irritation of the skin under the beard.
           Beard oil also works below the surface of the skin by working as a grooming tool, making the beard itself more manageable, neat and smooth.
           Beard oil also improves the way a beard looks by giving it a slight shine. This makes a beard look healthier as well</p>
